# Why Becoming a Member

We are in the early stages and seeking the first 100 founding members of this community. We recognize that these initial members will help shape the culture as we continue to grow. Therefore, we are searching for truly talented, optimistic, and innovative individuals who align with our vision and genuinely care about the problem we aim to solve.

There are 3 main reasons to become a member:

1. You are deeply dissatisfied with the political and cultural status quo, have no strong political affiliations, and want to be part of building a prosperous society that is better suited to the digital age.
2. You want to connect with international leaders and collaborate with optimistic and ambitious individuals such as builders, entrepreneurs, artists, educators, technologists, and scientists who are aligned with ideas of freedom and innovation, and become a member.
3. You want access to benefits, including event discounts, exclusive content, a network of services, co-working spaces, and potentially housing, physical infrastructure, and special jurisdictions to build startups.
