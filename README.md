# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to TNS Brazil!

{% hint style="info" %}
_"Itâ€™s easy to burn it all down. Itâ€™s exciting to do. You get the sense of transgression. You get the sense of doing it all collectively together. â€˜Weâ€™re making history and destroying itâ€™. But against that is transhumanism, where youâ€™re going to the stars. Youâ€™re transcending this human body, we are doing brain-machine interface. Weâ€™re doing limb regeneration. Weâ€™re doing CRISPR, and weâ€™re taking away all the limits, thus infinite frontier, immutable money, eternal life." Balaji S._

## What is TNS Brazil?

We are a community that believes in the **power of technological innovation** and **human freedom** to **drive progress**.&#x20;

Our vision is that legacy institutions are outdated for addressing the challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, we need digital-native institutions and startup societies to tackle global issues and unleash the full potential of humanity.
