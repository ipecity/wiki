# ðŸŽ¯ Our Goals

Our goal is to build a network society with crypto governance, and citizens highly aligned around the idea of human progress through technology and freedom.

To achieve this, we need to build three layers: the social layer (culture/values/politics), the technological layer (governance/infrastructure), and the economic layer.

**Social Layer:**

The social layer will be established by continuously recruiting and selecting new members who align with our goals, as well as cultivating a cohesive, trustworthy, and productive community. This layer is the most important, and we will initially invest the majority of our energy here.

To achieve this, we have a long and still incomplete roadmap. However, all upcoming phases will be somehow connected to these four approaches: Talk, Meet, Work, and Live.

* **Talk:** Creating content and online discussion environments for learning about digital society, decentralized governance, cryptocurrencies, AI, biotech, and other emerging technologies.
* **Meet:** Establishing in-person settings such as meetups, summits, conferences, popup villages, hackathons, and other gatherings. The goal is to facilitate deeper exchanges and the development of trust and bonds among members. Essentially, it is the creation of a decentralized network of ongoing in-person gatherings worldwide.
* **Work (5+ years):** Enabling online and in-person environments for developing medium-to-long-term open-source and onchain projects that propel the community toward our ultimate goal. To achieve this, we will establish a network of coworking spaces (online and physical), and innovative areas exclusively for members to collaborate and work on aligned projects.
* **Live (10+ years):** If the community is successful, we can expand it by crowdfunding territories where members can settle and colive using the IpÃª City passport. In other words, a network of villages, condominiums, cottages, and small towns worldwide where members can move, stay, and own property.

**Tech Layer:**

As we build and foster the community, we will channel our internal energy toward developing and fostering the creation of aligned projects and startups. This could encompass a wide range of areas, including governance platforms (e.g., AI allocating budgets for public goods), identity (e.g., on-chain ID with zero-knowledge proof), education (e.g., AI tutors for children), laws (e.g., smart contract marketplaces), as well as physical infrastructure/architecture, and even media, entertainment, and philanthropy companies.

In essence, weâ€™ll develop and foster an ecosystem of solutions that support digital-native societies.

**Economic Layer:**

To ensure the sustainability of this startup society, a business model is needed. Although still in its early stages, we have already determined the direction.

Approved members from the recruitment process will pay **an annual fee** to access our network. Additionally, aligned brands can support the community through **sponsorships** and have their brands featured in our events and content.

The revenue will be used to support the core team, leaders, and projects through **bounties**. &#x20;

Moreover, we plan to launch a crypto token $IPE to capture the value created by the community including access, content, brand, land, tools, and other tangible or intangible assets. Initially, citizens will receive tokens for subscribing and collaborating, and they will play an internal social reputation role in the community.

Although there may be initial friction, our goal is not to attract individuals with short-term mindsets to the project. At the same time, we aim to reward and provide ownership to those who help construct this community in the long run.
