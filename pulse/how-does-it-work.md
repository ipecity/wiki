# ‚è∞ How does it work?

## Format, timeframe, and specifics

* Every two weeks we'll get two pulses
  * a mandatory pulse
  * a bonus pulse

Expect simple tasks that will take 1-2 minutes. These will evolve over time in complexity, as we aim higher. We might eventually introduce different layers of Pulses - so different types of tasks, with different levels of obligation. That said we will always have a basic Pulse, which we expect everyone to contribute to.

Every single Pulse will be in strict alignment with our mission. We might eventually want to reward the exceptional work of one of the members by promoting something they did via Pulse. This would mean that basically, all members would help in distributing.&#x20;

Example: _Imagine a member made a great movie with AI about a gripping futuristic drama, while the backdrop was a world fully living in network states, which ended up being partly the solution to the drama._
