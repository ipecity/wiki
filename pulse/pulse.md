# Pulse

"*A network state is a highly aligned online community with a **capacity for collective action** that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states*"

Balaji Srinivasan, ["The Network State"](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-sentence). Chapter 1, pg. 2

## Collective action - what it is, why it's important and what is expected of you?

Joining a network state is a larger commitment than, say, joining a What'sApp group. One of the key differences is regarding collective action, which we call **Pulse** around here. 

**Collective action** is a coordinated action the whole network state performs simultaneously, within a timeframe. It could be as simple as liking a tweet or signing a petition defending a common interest. As we grow along with our capacity for execution, these tasks will evolve and have varying degrees of complexity. One of the resulting benefits is, assuming you're morally aligned with the [values](values.md), you're always building towards something you value and want to exist in the world

Collective action is something you already do, but don't think of it in those terms. If you've filed your tax reports, enjoyed the weekend or rolled your watch back 1 hour for daylight savings time, you have performed a collective action. This is not new, everyone does it all the time. Also, not doing it can be taken very seriously: *e.g. you can get arrested if you fail to pay your taxes*

This is particularly important for Startup Societies, no wonder it's literally within the first pages of the book. Beginnings are hard, and building up our execution capacity is crucial for success, following the [cloud first, land last](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-thousand-words) overall plan. We start out in the cloud and after growing the community in members and execution capacity we can start crowdfunding territory around the globe. If you haven't read the Network State's [1k word summary](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-thousand-words), it ties together how it all works.

**Let's be clear - if there's is no Pulse (collective action), there is no network state. Simple as that.**

As detailed in the following section, these will consists of very simple tasks which will few minutes per week. However we expect an adherence of 100%. Failing to deliver will permanently be on the member's record, will count against the member in the future, and in some extreme cases may lead to membership being revoked.

## Why Pulse?
In many ways startup societies are like living organisms, composed of individual entities contributing to a larger goal. Like anything that's alive, it needs resources to survive.

If you have a pulse, you're alive. The pulse radiates from the core (your heart) outwards, bringing life to all parts of the organism. When thinking about an organization, it's also important to keep everyone in sync and with their eyes on the ball. In bands, usually the drummer wears an earpiece with a pulse that dictates the tempo of the song everyone is playing.

Now moving away from the metaphorical, we believe the Pulse will accomplish all these things: nurture the organization, bring everyone together and keep everyone in sync and building towards the same direction

Also, as cool as the concept is, the name "collective action" doesn't exactly roll out the tongue! We prefer Pulse ðŸ˜‰

## Format, timeframe and specifics

- every two weeks we'll get two pulses
    - a mandatory pulse
    - a bonus pulse

Expect simple tasks that will take 1-2 minutes. These will evolve over time in complexity, as we aim higher. We might eventually introduce different layers of Pulses - so different types of tasks, with different levels of obligation. That said we will always have a basic Pulse, which we expect everyone to contribute to.

How serious is missing a mandatory Pulse? The best way to picture it is: imagine you were stranded in a desert island with a couple of people, fighting for survival together. How would others treat you if you didn't pull your weight? If you were to stay bathing in the sun while others worked, hunted and built? That's what you can expect if you don't contribute to the Pulse. Good news is, as we've said before, it'll be an exceendingly simple and quick task, so no matter how busy you are, you will be able to contribute.


Every single Pulse will be in strict alignment with our mission. We might eventually want to reward exceptional work of one of the members by promoting something they did via Pulse. This would mean that basically all members would help in distributing. Example: *imagine a member made a great movie with AI about a gripping futuristic drama, while the backdrop was a world fully living in network states, which ended up being partly the solution to the drama.*



## Future

With such a central role, we expect the scope and function of the Pulse to evolve over time. It can very well progress towards becoming a dashboard accessible to all, that monitors how healthy the organization is. It could be composed of many modules, one of which will be related to the collective aspect. 

But it could have a census, engagement metrics, token metrics... One vision, which is a low but solid building ground,[ was the one presented in the book](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-image). 

Cool, right? We're just getting started.
